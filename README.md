# C# Kata 5: Classes and Inheritance

1. Create an abstract class, Character, with properties Name, Health, and AttackPower.
2. Create an interface, IEvadable, which contains a float property, ChanceToEvade.
3. Create two public classes, Human and Enemy, both of which extend Character. The Enemy class should implement the IEvadable interface.
4. Create a static class named Battlefield. This class should have a public method named StartDuel, which takes two Character objects. This method should randomly select one character to attack the other (in a loop) until one of them has been defeated.
5. In the Program.cs file, instantiate the player and enemy objects and have them fight in the battlefield. (Remember to accommodate the enemyâ€™s ChanceToEvade property!)
6. Print the name of the winner to the console.
7. Bonus Points: Have the program pause for a bit between engagements, printing to the console if the player struck or missed the enemy.
